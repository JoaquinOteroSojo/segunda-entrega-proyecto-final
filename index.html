        <h4>The 60's</h4>
        <p>
          As electricity became more widely available, the early 20th century
          saw the invention of electronic musical instruments including the
          Telharmonium, Trautonium, Ondes Martenot, and theremin. In the late
          1930s, the Hammond Organ Company built the Novachord, a large
          instrument powered by 72 voltage-controlled amplifiers and 146 vacuum
          tubes. In 1948, the Canadian engineer Hugh Le Caine completed the
          electronic sackbut, a precursor to voltage-controlled synthesizers,
          with keyboard sensitivity allowing for vibrato, glissando, and attack
          control. In 1957, Harry Olson and Herbert Belar completed the RCA Mark
          II Sound Synthesizer at the RCA laboratories in Princeton, New Jersey.
          The instrument read punched paper tape that controlled an analog
          synthesizer containing 750 vacuum tubes. It was acquired by the
          Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center and used almost exclusively
          by Milton Babbitt, a composer at Princeton University.
        </p>
        <h4>The 70's</h4>

        <p>
          The authors of Analog Days define "the early years of the synthesizer"
          as between 1964 and the mid-1970s, beginning with the debut of the
          Moog synthesizer. Designed by American engineer Robert Moog, the
          synthesizer was composed of separate modules which created and shaped
          sounds, connected by patch cords. Moog developed a means of
          controlling pitch through voltage, the voltage-controlled oscillator.
          This, along with Moog components such as envelopes, noise generators,
          filters, and sequencers, became standards in the synthesizer market.
          Around the same period, American engineer Don Buchla created the
          Buchla Modular Electronic Music System. Instead of a conventional
          keyboard, Buchla's system used touchplates which transmitted control
          voltages depending on finger position and force. However, the Moog's
          keyboard made it more accessible and marketable to musicians, and
          keyboards became the standard means of controlling synthesizers. Moog
          and Buchla initially avoided the word synthesizer for their
          instruments, as it was associated with the RCA synthesizer; however,
          by the 1970s, "synthesizer" had become the standard term.
        </p>
        <h4>The 80's</h4>

        <p>
          In 1970, Moog launched a cheaper, smaller synthesizer, the Minimoog.
          The Minimoog was the first synthesizer sold in music stores, and was
          more practical for live performance; it standardized the concept of
          synthesizers as self-contained instruments with built-in keyboards.
          The Minimoog, introduced in 1970, was the first synthesizer sold in
          music stores. After retail stores started selling synthesizers in
          1971, other synthesizer companies were established, including ARP in
          the US and EMS in the UK. ARP's products included the ARP 2600, which
          folded into a carrying case and had built-in speakers, and the
          Odyssey, a rival to the Minimoog. The less expensive EMS synthesizers
          were used by European art rock and progressive rock acts including
          Brian Eno and Pink Floyd. Designs for synthesizers appeared in the
          amateur electronics market, such as the "Practical Electronics Sound
          Synthesiser", published in Practical Electronics in 1973. By the
          mid-1970s, ARP was the world's largest synthesizer manufacturer,
          though it closed in 1981. Early synthesizers were monophonic, meaning
          they could only play one note at a time. Some of the earliest
          commercial polyphonic synthesizers were created by American engineer
          Tom Oberheim, such as the OB-X (1979). In 1978, the American company
          Sequential Circuits released the Prophet-5, the first fully
          programmable polyphonic synthesizer. The Prophet-5 used
          microprocessors for patch memory, allowing users to store sounds. This
          overcame a major difficulty in previous synthesizers, which required
          users to adjust cables and knobs to change sounds, with no guarantee
          of exactly recreating a sound. This facilitated a move from
          synthesizers creating unpredictable sounds to producing "a standard
          package of familiar sounds".
        </p>
        <h4>The 90's</h4>

        <p>
          The synthesizer market grew dramatically in the 1980s. 1982 saw the
          introduction of MIDI, a standardized means of synchronizing electronic
          instruments; it remains an industry standard. An influential sampling
          synthesizer, the Fairlight CMI, was released in 1979, with the ability
          to record and play back samples at different pitches. Though its high
          price made it inaccessible to amateurs, it was adopted by high-profile
          pop musicians including Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel. The success of
          the Fairlight drove competition, improving sampling technology and
          lowering prices; early competing samplers included the E-mu Emulator
          in 1981 and the Akai S-series in 1985. The Yamaha DX7, released in
          1983, was the first commercially successful digital synthesizer and
          was widely used in 1980s pop music. In 1983, Yamaha released the first
          commercially successful digital synthesizer, the Yamaha DX7. Based on
          frequency modulation (FM) synthesis developed by Stanford University
          engineer John Chowning, the DX7 remains one of the bestselling
          synthesizers in history and was the first synthesizer to sell over
          100,000 units. It was widely used in 1980s pop music. Compared to the
          "warm" and "fuzzy" sounds of analog synthesis, the DX7 was
          characterized by its "harsh", "glassy" and "chilly" sounds. Digital
          synthesizers typically contained preset sounds emulating acoustic
          instruments, with algorithms controlled with menus and buttons. The
          Synclavier, a digital synthesizer made with FM technology licensed
          from Yamaha, offered features such as 16-bit sampling and built-in
          digital recording. With a starting price of $13,000, its use was
          limited to universities, studios and wealthy artists. The success of
          the DX7 led to competing digital synthesizers. The Roland D-50 (1987)
          blended Roland's linear arithmetic algorithm with samples, and was the
          first mass-produced synthesizer with built-in digital effects such as
          delay, reverb and chorus. In 1988, the Japanese manufacturer Korg
          released the M1, a digital synthesizer workstation featuring sampled
          transients and loops; with over 250,000 units sold, it remains the
          bestselling synthesizer in history. The advent of digital synthesizers
          led to a downturn in interest in analog synthesizers.
        </p>
        <h4>Today</h4>

        <p>
          Whereas once synthesizers had filled rooms, they can now be embedded
          on microchips in any electronic device and accurately emulated by
          software. 1997 saw the release of ReBirth by Propellerhead Software
          and Reality by Seer Systems, the first software synthesizers that
          could be played in real time via MIDI. In 1999, an update to the music
          software Cubase allowed users to run software instruments (including
          synthesizers) as plug-ins, triggering a wave of new software
          instruments. Propellerhead's Reason, released in 2000, offered an
          array of recognizable virtual studio equipment. The market for
          patchable and modular synthesizers rebounded in the late 1990s. In the
          2000s, older analog synthesizers regained popularity, sometimes
          selling for much more than their original prices. In the 2010s, new,
          affordable analog synthesizers were introduced by companies including
          Moog, Korg, Arturia, and Dave Smith Instruments. The renewed interest
          is credited to the appeal of imperfect "organic" sounds and simpler
          interfaces, and modern surface-mount technology making analog
          synthesizers cheaper and faster to manufacture.
