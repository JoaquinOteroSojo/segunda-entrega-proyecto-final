            The troublesome evolution from the Harpsichord to the Synthesizer,

            Three pianos by Cristofori survive, at the Metropolitan Museum of
            Art (1720; 89.4.1219); at the Museo Strumenti Musicali in Rome
            (1722); and at the Musikinstrumenten-Museum of Leipzig University
            (1726). The Metropolitan’s Cristofori, the oldest surviving piano,
            is in a plain wing-shaped case, outwardly resembling a harpsichord.
            It has a single keyboard and no special stops, in much the same
            style as Italian harpsichords of the day. (The keyboards of the two
            other surviving pianos by Cristofori can be shifted slightly so that
            only one of the two strings of each pitch will be struck, i.e., una
            corda, thereby quieting the entire instrument.) The sound of the
            Museum’s 1720 Cristofori differs considerably from the modern grand
            piano. Its range is narrower—54 rather than 88 keys—and its thinner
            strings and harder hammers give it a timbre closer to a harpsichord
            than a modern Steinway. Maffei commented that, because of its
            somewhat muted tone, Cristofori’s piano was best suited for solos or
            to accompany a voice or single instrument, rather than for larger
            ensemble work. Indeed, a contemporary harpsichord was a louder and
            more brilliant instrument, but lacked the ability to respond to the
            strength of the player’s touch, and so could achieve no significant
            gradations in dynamic expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the piano, the clavichord (1986.239) is also capable of
            detailed gradations of loud and soft controlled by the player’s
            touch, but this intimate stringed instrument is overall so soft that
            it can barely be heard a few feet away, and so is useless in
            ensembles or in concert. Cristofori’s invention was initially slow
            to catch on in Italy, but five pianos by Cristofori or his pupil
            Giovanni Ferrini were purchased by Queen Maria Barbara de Braganza
            of Spain, patron and student of Domenico Scarlatti (1685–1757).
            Hundreds of Scarlatti’s more than 500 single-movement keyboard
            sonatas may have been intended for piano, rather than harpsichord as
            has long been assumed. The earliest music definitely written and
            published specifically for the piano were twelve Sonate da cimbalo
            di piano e forte detto volgarmente di martelletti (Florence, 1732)
            by Lodovico Giustini (1685–1743), dedicated to Don Antonio of
            Portugal, uncle of Maria Barbara and another student of Scarlatti.
            The sonatas contain nuanced expressions such as più forte and più
            piano, fine dynamic gradations impossible to execute on a
            harpsichord. Maffei’s description, which includes a diagram of
            Cristofori’s action, was translated into German and included in
            Johann Mattheson’s Critica musica of 1725, where it was probably
            read by Gottfried Silbermann (1683–1753), the important Saxon court
            organ builder. Based on Cristofori’s design, Silbermann began work
            on his own pianos in the 1730s.
          </p>
          <p>
            An early model was dismissed by Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) as
            possessing too heavy a touch and too weak a treble. With actual
            firsthand experience of one of Cristofori’s instruments and
            subsequent improvements, Silbermann’s pianos were more successful,
            leading to the purchase of several by Frederick the Great, king of
            Prussia (r. 1740–86). Bach later praised Silbermann’s pianos, going
            so far as to become a sales agent for his instruments, thereby
            extending the influence of Cristofori’s creation in central Europe
            during the years following the Paduan instrument maker’s death.

          <p>
            Your list of all-time favourite film scores should feature some
            Howard Shore pieces. It just has to be. His longest-running
            collaborations in film brought the Canadian composer to deliver some
            of the most illustrious film music compositions. For David
            Cronenberg—he scored all his films since The Brood (1979)—he created
            haunting, poisonous soundscapes that unmistakably match the themes
            dear to the filmmaker. Whether they are led by guitars (Crash,
            1996), electronic instruments (Videodrome, 1983; Scanners, 1981) or
            a symphonic orchestra (The Fly, 1986; M. Butterfly, 1993), his
            scores, just like Cronenberg’s characters, would mutate, reshaped by
            the film’s final form and genre. Shore and Ornette Coleman’s
            free-jazz experimental compositions for Naked Lunch (1991) have
            nothing to do, musically, with the delicately sad score for Spider
            (2002), yet both delve into the main character’s sick mind and deal
            with its fateful consequences with a radically different approach.
            And the same goes on with the rest of their common filmography, with
            different themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Martin Scorsese—six collaborations starting with After Hours
            (1985)—he disseminated elements of tango (The Departed, 2006),
            French folk music (Hugo, 2011) or Irish traditional music (Gangs of
            New York, 2002) within orchestral compositions. But his best-known
            collaboration was with Peter Jackson, with The Lord of the Rings
            trilogy, with a large number of Shore’s pieces becoming instant
            classics of film music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Howard Shore’s dark, mind-bending compositions also led him to score
            Jonathan Demme’s The Silence of the Lambs (1991) and David Fincher’s
            Seven (1995), two of the most-acclaimed American thrillers of the
            late-20th century, but noticeably overlooked are his more
            lighthearted compositions, like his score for Tom Hanks’s
            directorial debut, That Thing You Do! (1996) or Kevin Smith’s Dogma
            (1999). Left-out gems like these abound in Howard Shore’s
            filmography, sometimes hiding even more curious secrets—did you know
            that Howard Shore composed the original theme for Saturday Night
            Live, for which he served as the music director for five years, and
            it is he, in fact, who came up with the name The Blues Brothers for
            John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd’s band?
          </p>
          <p>
            As of today, French audiences can discover Howard Shore’s latest
            work in The Lost Prince, the seventh feature film by The Artist
            director Michel Hazanavicius. Starring Omar Sy as a single dad who
            tells his eight-year-old daughter tales before she goes to sleep,
            the film mixes the story with dream sequences in which the daughter
            is the princess and the father is the Brave Prince… Until she grows
            up and eventually falls in love for the first time. Fresh off the
            Rotterdam Film Festival, where Shore gave a live rendition for a new
            cut of Crash, we asked him about his fairy-tale-infused score with
            an unexpected Disney flavour.

            It’s the beginning of the week and we’re barely recovering from our
            watching of the Safdie Bros’ latest diamond in the rough, Uncut
            Gems, which was released on Netflix on January 31. And boy are we
            still shooketh by the experience. It was an immersive,
            stress-inducing, anxiety-triggering, frantic, relentless,
            chew-you-up-and-spit-you-out experience. But totally worth it, would
            recommend and do it again.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what you get when you mix the brotherly duo with their
            favourite composer, Daniel Lopatin, aka Oneohtrix Point Never.
            Before they worked together on their first collaboration, Good Time
            (2017), Josh and Benny Safdie had a strong interest in Oneohtrix
            Point Never’s work, Josh describing his albums as “very conceptual”,
            and saying that the musician “was making basically scores for movies
            that didn’t exist“. Daniel Lopatin had heard about the directors
            wanting to work with someone who was ready to create a tailor-made
            score. And boom, it was a match:
          </p>
          <p>
            “I feel like the Safdie brothers are similar to me personality-wise,
            so that when we worked, it didn’t feel like there was an enormous
            amount of effort to try to come to a consensus of understanding
            about how this is gonna go. There weren’t cue sheets, there was
            nothing. There was like hanging out, geeking out about stuff that we
            were excited about … partying, becoming friends, and making the film
            as punchy and as insane as we wanted it to be. It was fun.” (Rolling
            Stone)
